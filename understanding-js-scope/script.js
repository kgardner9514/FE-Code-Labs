/**
 * TASKS
 
1. Create three variables in the global scople called firstName, lastName and age, and a function that
logs them to the console in the following format e.g. 'John Smith is 25 years old.'

2. Move the variables into the local scope of the function and add another kvariable this time called
country, add this to our statement '...and lives in England.'

3. Outside of the function change the firstName to 'James', did you encounter a problem?

4. What will the following code return?
    let game = 'Sonic';

    if (true) {
        let game = 'Mario';
        console.log(game);
    }

    console.log(game);

    function user() {        
        let firstName = 'John';

        let age = '25';
        let country = 'England'
        console.log(`${firstName} ${lastName} is ${age} years old and lives in ${country}`);
